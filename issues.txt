layer z_depth if changed manually doesn't work then

TANGENT_FACTOR optimal: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/blob/master/ETL/ETL/_hermite.h
TANGENT_IN_FACTOR gives better results at constant value of 3.5
TANGENT_OUT_FACTOR gives better results at constant value of 2.9

Next GSOC Mentor Idea: 
-> Convert lottie(.json) format to .sif format
-> implement the convert methods present in animation in synfig
-> Generate color for each frame in case of bezier interpolation
-> Might be helpful at the end of GSOC: https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web/issues/1614

TODOS:
Change opacity documentation in developer documentation
Documentation: Only linear interpolation are allowed for color in after effects

Inner Radius - Polygon interpolation problem:
-> perpendicular distance in polygon = or*Cos(theta/2)
    -> Finding this will depend upon the number of points
    -> If number of points is chaning somewhere in the animation, then more waypoints need to be introduced
    -> For simplicity, assume that number of points is not changing yet
        -> After this deal with difficult problem of `changing number of points of star`
-> Never consider it as a polygon, always make inner radius equal to the above given value
    -> To do this, will have to implement the tcb value finder in python
    -> To find subsection of bezier: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/317806/equation-for-subsection-of-bezier-curve
    -> Waypoint not always starts from zero, so take the value from it's first waypoint
    -> Inner radius needs to be changed as many times as needed according to the outer radius
