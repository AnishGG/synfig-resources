TANGENT_FACTOR optimal: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/blob/master/ETL/ETL/_hermite.h
LOttie calculates bezier as: https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web/blob/master/player/js/utils/PropertyFactory.js

Use Repeater of Adobe after effects in Duplicate layer of Synfig

Next GSOC Mentor Idea: 
-> Convert lottie(.json) format to .sif format
-> implement the convert methods present in animation in synfig
-> Generate color for each frame in case of bezier interpolation
-> Might be helpful at the end of GSOC: https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web/issues/1614
-> Fork lottie-web, support your animations by editing the structure [will reduce the file size hugely]

TODOS:
Function documentation: https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html
Documentation: https://www.tablesgenerator.com/text_tables
TCB values for inserted waypoints need to be determined: Improvement:- For now average of tcb is taken
    -> To find subsection of bezier: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/317806/equation-for-subsection-of-bezier-curve
[Later, Not a need now]Make a wrapper for finding vector at time t for waypoint such that, if not animated: make it animated inside that first function itselves
[Later] Make class layer
